# City of Ghosts

## About the Project

This is a reimagining of an old idea to try and find a good way to leverage Discord bots to make a game drawing influence with older MUD/MUSH games and Tabletop PbP, but with the ability to be run entirely in a Discord server.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Validate Twee files
npm run validate

# Build the game
npm run build

# Open dist/index.html in your browser to play
```

For detailed development instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Twee source files for the interactive story
- `scripts/` - Build and validation scripts
- `dist/` - Compiled game output (generated)
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD configuration

## The Basics 
I 've recently started getting back into Twine and this time around I would like to try putting it all together with Twee within VSCode rather than the Twine visual editor for a number of different reasons (among which are making use of VSCode features and extensions to keep me organized and make my life easier).  While there are a lot of interesting formats out there, I plan to put this story together with Sugarcube because it is a good mix of readability and functionality and will allow for the use of Twine custom macros to help streamline some of the features.

## The Inspiration

When I first saw the trailer for Disco Elysium, I did not think that a Cop RPG would really appeal to me, but it kept on coming up in my radar and people were praising the ingenuity of the writing and ranting about how much it felt like it was staying true to the theme of tabletop, so I finally decided to give it a try and I am so glad that I did.  I was pretty impacted by what it was able to accomplish, even with its limitations.

While my goal is not to mimic the game entirely, I do want to build on the same foundation, making your skills actually part of who you are playing and not just a set of numbers to be used.  This was made even easier by the discovery of [Disco Elysium Twine Macros](https://github.com/apepers/DiscoElysiumTwineMacros) by **apepers**, who I am thankful for.
